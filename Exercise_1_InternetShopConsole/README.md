
In this lab, we created a Java project for an online store simulation. The project consisted of several classes:

1. Product: This class represented information about a product, including its ID, name, price, and description.
2. Category: The Category class defined the category of a product, such as electronics or clothing.
3. Cart: The Cart class stored the products that a user added to their shopping cart.
4. Order: The Order class defined an order made up of products in the cart.

We implemented basic functionality such as adding products to the cart, displaying the cart, and checking out. We also created a simple text-based user interface to allow users to interact with the store. Additionally, we added features like removing products from the cart, saving order history for users, and implementing a search functionality for products by name or category. Finally, we discussed how to upload the project to a GitHub repository, including creating a new repository, adding files, committing changes, and pushing to the main branch.
